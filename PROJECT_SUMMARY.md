- Functions for staking, service usage, and provider operations
- Mock data simulation for blockchain interactions

#### Reusable Components
1. **Button** - Multi-variant button with consistent styling
2. **Card** - Container component with hover effects
3. **Modal** - Accessible dialog for user interactions
4. **Navigation** - Responsive navigation with wallet connection
5. **ServiceCard** - Service display with all details
6. **StakingPoolCard** - Pool information display

#### Type Safety
- **types/index.ts**: Complete TypeScript definitions for:
  - Service types and interfaces
  - Staking pool structures
  - User data models
  - Provider service models

#### Mock Data
- **data/mockData.ts**: Realistic sample data for:
  - 6 diverse services
  - 3 staking pools
  - User stakes and rewards
  - Service usage history

### 🎨 Design & UX

- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional design with Tailwind CSS
- **Color Scheme**: Primary blue theme with semantic colors
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design that works on all devices
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and hover effects
- **Icons**: Emoji-based icons for quick visual recognition

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Framework & Tools
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Solana Web3.js 3.0.0
- Wallet Adapter libraries

#### Best Practices Followed
✅ Component-based architecture
✅ DRY principle (no code duplication)
✅ Type safety throughout
✅ Consistent code style
✅ Clear file organization
✅ Separation of concerns
✅ Reusable utilities
✅ Mock data abstraction

#### Performance Optimizations
- Static site generation (SSG)
- Image optimization disabled for GitHub Pages
- Code splitting with Next.js
- Efficient re-renders with React Context
- Minimal bundle size

### 📦 Deployment Ready

#### GitHub Pages Configuration ✅
- **next.config.js**: Static export configuration
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated deployment workflow
- **.nojekyll**: Prevents Jekyll processing
- **basePath**: Configured for repository subdirectory
